## Project Overview
In this project, we explore the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) data set through exploratory data analysis and predictive modelling. We use a variety of machine learning (ML) models in an attempt to classify each image to its correct number. These models include, but are not limited to, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and neural networks such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNS). 

## Data Information
The data set contains images of a variety of handwritten numbers between 0-9, where each image is given as an array of 28x28 pixels, each pixel having a value between 0 and 255 representing the intensity.
